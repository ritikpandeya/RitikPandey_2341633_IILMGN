# Smart Energy Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
This project monitors and predicts energy consumption using machine learning techniques to promote efficient power usage.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- data_train.py → trains the ML model
- model.pkl → saved trained model
- predict.py → predicts energy usage
- live_check.py → performs live monitoring

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Python, Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and predict energy usage for efficient energy management.

Developed as part of academic work at IILM University Greater Noida.
